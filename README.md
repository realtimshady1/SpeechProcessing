# Speech Processing
The speech processing neural network is a deep learning algorithm that tries to classify audio data according to a perceived emotion. The dataset foundation is the [Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/24487), which contains 2800 prelabelled audio data. There will certainly be challenges in meeting training data requirements and hopefully it will be a learning opportunity to find feasible solutions to supplement the limited data.
